description: Learn about how developer mode for commands allows you to iterate faster on your commands
---

Dev mode exists to make it easier to iterate on your commands. When enabled it will register all your commands in a given guild, regardless of the command settings. This is important because guild commands refresh instantly, but global commands are cached.

To get started you can enable `dev` in your client settings, we'll also need to provide our development guild id:

```ts {9-12}
import { JellyCommands } from 'jellycommands';
import { IntentsBitField } from 'discord.js';

const client = new JellyCommands({
	clientOptions: {
		intents: [IntentsBitField.Flags.Guilds],
	},

	dev: {
		global: true,
		guilds: ['...'],
	},
});

client.login();
```

:::caution
You should always use a seperate bot for development, since JellyCommands overwrites commands to ensure they're set correctly.
