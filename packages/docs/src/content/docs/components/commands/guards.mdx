description: Learn about protecting your commands with JellyCommands guards.
---

Guards provide a good developer experience for protecting your commands.

:::note
At the moment, we use Discord's permissions system. We'd like to support local guards in the future!
:::

## Permissions

You can specify which users are permitted to use a command by referencing their guild permissions.

```js {7-11}
import { command } from 'jellycommands';

export default command({
	name: 'commandname',
	description: 'A short description of what the command does',

	guards: {
		// This means only people with the Administrator
		// permission can use the command
		permissions: ['Administrator'],
	},

	run: ({ interaction }) => {
		// Do something with interaction
	},
});
```
