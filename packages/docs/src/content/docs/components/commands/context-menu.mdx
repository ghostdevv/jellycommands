title: Context Menu Commands
description: Learn how to write User and Message context menu commands for your Discord bot with JellyCommands.
---

Context menu commands appear when you right-click on a `message` or `user` in Discord. They provide quick actions without needing to type a slash command. Therefore there are two types: `messageCommand` and `userCommand`. Unlike slash commands, these are more relaxed on the name casing.

## Message Commands

Message commands appear in the context menu when right-clicking a message. They're perfect for actions like translating, bookmarking, or reporting messages. Here's how to create one:

```js
import { messageCommand } from 'jellycommands';

export default messageCommand({
	name: 'Save Message',

	async run({ interaction }) {
		const message = interaction.targetMessage;
		await interaction.reply(`Saved message: ${message.content}`);
	},
});
```

## User Commands

User commands show up when you right-click a user's avatar or name. They're useful for actions like viewing profiles, sending friend requests, or adding roles. Here's an example:

```js
import { userCommand } from 'jellycommands';

export default userCommand({
	name: 'Get Join Date',

	async run({ interaction }) {
		const targetUser = interaction.targetUser;

		await interaction.reply(
			`${targetUser.tag} joined discord on ${targetUser.createdAt}`,
		);
	},
});
```
